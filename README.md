The game is the traditional 9*9 Sudoku game. Win condition is filling all the blanks without conflicting any repeating number. You will see a win signal once you win!
Once a conflict occurs, the grid will turn to red to indicate the player is wrong and a toaster will appear at the right bottom will also tell the player they are wrong.
If the number put in is correct, the blank will turn blue.

There is a button at the left top which explain what the game is and what the game logic is.

Timer is at the right top which counts the time of player solving the puzzle. You can reset it and pause it.

New puzzle will help you generate a new game board.
